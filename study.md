## HTTP

HTTP is a protocol - a system of rules - that determines how documents are
transferred from one place to another. Among other things, it defines the format
of the messages passed between *clients* and *servers*.

"Clients" send *requests* and receive *responses*. Examples include browsers
(like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) and other programs like
[`curl`](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/) and
[`wget`](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html).

"Servers" receive requests and send responses. Examples are more complex, since
there are different kinds of servers. There are application servers, which work
in Node or Ruby to generate documents using those languages, and there are web
servers like [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), [nginx](http://nginx.com/), and
[lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net). The word "server" is also used to describe
the machine that these programs run on. In this document, the latter is what we
mean when we say "server", as in this diagram:

1.  A client sends a request to a server.
1.  The server processes the request.
1.  The response gets sent back to the client.
1.  The client processes the response.

## URLs

Which server is the request sent to? How does the server know what to respond
with? Both of these questions are answered by *uniform resource locator (URL)*.

Study each part of a URL using the [Mozilla Developer Network
Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL).

## HTTP Verbs

A request has two parts: a URL and a verb. A request without both is incomplete.

By default, the browser issues GET requests when you type a URL into the address
bar and press `enter`. When you submit forms, the browser typically issues a
POST request.

## Make a Request

Make a request using the browser. Go to [Google](https://www.google.com). When
you clicked this link, the browser made a GET request to Google's server. We
often describe requests like this:

```txt
GET https://www.google.com/
```

If we know we're working with a particular server, we might shorten abbreviate
it as follows. For example, if Google had API documentation that described
requests you could make to it's server, that documentation might say instead:

```txt
GET /
```

In other words, API docs often only describe the URI instead of the full URL.

The response your browser receives from Google is an HTML document the browser
parses and renders. What would happen if you made the same get request outside
of the browser?

Try this in your terminal:

```sh
curl --request GET https://www.google.com
```

What did you see?

## Responses & Resources

Servers send responses, and those responses contain resource representations.

Technically, the term "resource" refers to an abstraction that your application
uses; depending on what the application does, a resource might be a 'Car', a
'Person', a 'User', or an 'Order Cart'.

A single resource can be represented in multiple different ways by the server,
including a HTML, JSON, PDF files, and images. What we really mean when we say
"resource" above is a specific representation of a resource.

You may think of resources as the documents that are returned (usually HTML or
JSON) as part of the response body.

## Response Statuses

What are HTTP status codes?

## Questions

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Define HTTP

In your own words, give a breif description of what HTTP is.

```md
HTTP is a protocol for how information is passed between clients and servers.
One part of this protocol is the formatting between these entities so each side
can both send and interpret the information necessary to process the request.

## Describe what a client is and what a server is

 What is a client is and what is a server? How do they interact with each other?

```md
A client is a device or machine that may need information from a server to
properly complete a task for a user. A server is often a machine that is used
to store information to be used by clients. The server also must be able to
understand client requests and return the appropriate information. The two
interact through requests and responses. The client requests information, the
server interprets that request and responds with the appropriate information.

## Describe the 4 most common HTTP verbs

What are the 4 most common HTTP verbs used when creating a RESTful API. How
would you use each?

```md
GET - Get information. This could be used to retrieve a webpage.

POST - Create and store information. This may be used for a product review or a
new user profile.

PUT - Update information. This could be used to fix a bug in existing software
or update a roster of players on a team.

DELETE - Delete information. This could be used to delete a profile or review.

```

## Describe what a Response is

What is a response? what does it contain? What are some common status codes in a
response and what do they mean?

```md
A response is what the server will return to the client after the client makes a
request. A response contains the requested information, if possible, as well as
data about the response itself, including status codes and a timestamp. Some
common status codes are 200 (OK), 404 (not found), and 500 (internal server
error).

## Make a curl request

Using curl, how would you get the content from Reddit.com?

```md
curl --request GET https://www.reddit.com

Modified from Google example above.
```

## Describe the parts of a URL

List the parts of a URL and explain what each part is, in your own words. You'll
refer to this list often in the next few weeks, so it's important to keep it in
an easy-to-reference place.

```md
URL Scheme - The scheme or protocol being used to transfer the information
Host - The address of the computer that is hosting the information. This can be
a domain name or an IP address.
Port Number - The location of the information on the machine on which it is
hosted. This is often omitted from URLs because port numbers are often
standardized to 80 for http and 443 for https.
URL Path - The local path to the information requested. This is the path of the
file system just like the ones we've been using on our machines.
Query - Additional information that can be used by the server to access the
correct information like a discount code or a username.
